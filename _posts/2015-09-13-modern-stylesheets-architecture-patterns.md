This week I was asked to prepare some presentation on how to embrace stylesheets in large scaled projects. A lot of front-end developers underestimate power of well structured stylesheets and think about stylesheets as a not challenging task - but it can be a tricky trap when it comes about future maintenance.

I've went through some stylesheets modern techniques and patterns and pretty quickly I've found this [post by Una Kravets](http://www.sitepoint.com/atomic-oobemitscss/) which explains a pattern combination called (silly) OOBEMITSCSS.
