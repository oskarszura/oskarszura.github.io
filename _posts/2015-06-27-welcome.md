Hello there! My name is Oskar and I'm 29 years old front-end developer (also NodeJS developer) from Krak√≥w, Poland. I'm gonna say a few words about me. I have over 6 years of experience in widely understood webdevelopment (C#, PHP) and over 3 years of experience in front-end development.

Why I've started this blog? I guess I just want to share some knowledge and experience with anyone who wants to master the secrets of widely understood front-end development - that's it :).

If you have any suggestions about how to improve this place don't hesitate to email me at oskar.szura@gmail.com.
